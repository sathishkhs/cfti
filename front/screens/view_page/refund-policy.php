                CFTIINDIA deeply values all contributions to sustain our mission. However, in the event when you want to cancel your donation, we take care of making it a smooth transaction. CFTIINDIA follows a reliable refund policy to let our donors feel privileged about their association with us. We take utmost care about processing donations as per the mandates signed by our donors in the donor forms, both offline and online. But in case of an unlikely event of an erroneous deduction or if the donor wants to cancel/deduct the donation, CFTIINDIA will respond within 7 working days from the date of receiving the request from donor. The timely refund of the wrongly deduced amount will depend on type of card used during transaction. We would require a proof of deduction of the donation amount and a written communication for refund from the donor within two days after donation.

                <p>
                In such cases if the receipt already has been issued, then the donor needs to return the original receipt at our official address:
