<h6>Personal Information</h6>
CFTIINDIA uses its best efforts to respect the privacy of its online visitors. At our site, we do not collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we do not require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our website. CFTIINDIA only gathers personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, zip/postal codes, e-mail addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. For example, we ask for personal information on our online donation pages, and use this information to acknowledge receipt of your donation for tax purposes.
CFTIINDIA does not sell or trade such information collected to third parties. We will not share personally identifiable information with third parties unless authorized by the person submitting the information or required by law.
<h6>Credit Card Information Security</h6>
CFTIINDIA uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect the security of your transaction and the confidentiality of your personal information. This makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us.
Credit card information is not sold or traded to third parties. We will not share credit card information with third parties unless required by law.
If you still have concerns about the security of your credit card information, contributions may also be made by sending personal cheques or money orders to:

<h6>Security</h6>
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
 
<h6>Donations</h6>
We request information from the visitor on our donation form. A visitor must provide contact information (such as name, e-mail and mailing address) and payment information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and for sending receipt of the donation. If we have trouble processing a donation, the information is used by us to contact the visitor. If the visitor has given permission for the information's release, the visitor's name and contact information may be shared with carefully selected organisations and charities we feel our donors would want to know about. Where requested, we will provide information on larger donations to appropriate charities and donors for tax purposes. Financial and credit card information are never released.
 
<h6>Opt-Out</h6>
If you supply us with your postal address or e-mail address on-line you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on our programs and services. If you do not want to receive postal mail or e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by sending email to us at: amit@cftiindia.com or writing to us at the above address and telling us that you do not want to receive postal mail or e-mail from us. Some mailings are prepared well in advance, so please allow up to three months for your request to be properly reflected on our mailing lists.
 
<h6>Cookies</h6>

Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. CFTIINDIA uses cookie technology only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors' online experience and facilitate their visit within our site.

<h6>Notification of Changes</h6>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so our visitors are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
If, however, we are going to use visitors' personally identifiable information in a manner significantly different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify visitors via e-mail and won't disclose this information unless express information is granted. However, if visitors have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.
